Guideline for   Research   Project
This   research   project aims to develop your critical thinking   and   research   skills   by   drawing   on   empirical data.   It   requires you to organise a   piece   of   mini   research   by   library   research   and develop   logic arguments with detailed support.   First, you will   identify   a   piece/sof   high quality Chinese   literary or   media work that you   have   enjoyed   reading for this   project.
Second, you are expected to analyse   some   specific   aspects   of this   piece   of work   in   depth from critical   perspectives and   maintain coherence and   consistency throughout   the   whole project.   It   is advised that   it   is your   responsibility to select a   topic   of   interest,   identify   the exact   piece/s of work, search   previous   research on this work   through   a   range   of   academic sources   (esp. the Chinese database   below) and   develop your   own   findings/arguments   based   on the   research   under the close guidance of your tutor   in this   unit.
To complete this   project, you   need to do three   assessment tasks   on   analysing the   same   Chinese   literary work or   media   articles:
1)       a   research   proposal   (5%)   (due   in Week   5)
2)       an oral   presentation   (15%)   (due   in   multiple weeks from Week   6-13)
3)       a   research   project   report   (35%)   (due   in Week   13)
Detailed   requirements for each task are   listed   below.
Research   proposal
In Week 5 of the semester, you   are   required   to   submit   a   brief   proposal   for   the   research project   in   200 words   (i.e., about 300 Chinese   characters).   Prior to   your   research   on   the chosen topic, your   proposal   must   be   reviewed and approved   by your tutor, who   will   provide   detailed feedback and suggestion for your   project. You   need to   list   your   primary   and   possible secondary data   in   the   proposal.
Primary data: the text/s to   be analysed for this   project.
•          In this   unit, only   literary/non-literary work originally   published   in   Chinese   after   May      4th    Movement   (1919) or   media articles   published   in the   past   10 years   can   be   used   as   primary   data.
•          Please   be   noted that any   texts discussed   in the   lectures   and   tutorials   cannot   be   used   as   primary data for this   project.
•         Also, translated work from other   languages or works   published   earlier than   1919   cannot   be   used for this   project.
Secondary data:   previous   research   literature on the topic chosen or   the   texts   to   be   analysed.
The following database fully available via the   Fisher   Library website   would   be   extremely   helpful for developing this   project as the source   of   secondary   data.
CAJ: China Academic Journal   Full-text   Database via CNKI
https://www.library.sydney.edu.au/browse/databases
The   proposal should   include
1)       preliminary   title   of   the   project
2)         primary   data
3)         possible secondary   data
4)       possible   research focus or   research   question.
All the contents   in the   proposal can   be amended   or   changed   due to   your   further   reading   and thinking,   but   major changes to the   primary data should   be   re-approved   by your tutor.   Samples of   research   proposal can   be found   in the Course   Reader.
Oral   presentation
This   is the opportunity for you to share your   research   in   progress   with   your   teachers   and peer classmates and to seek their feedback   and   suggestions.   A   10-minute   oral   presentation   plus 5-minute Q  A with   preparation of   around   10-12   PPT   slides   will   start   in the   tutorial from Week 6.   In the   presentation, you are   expected
-   to demonstrate ability to establish and   develop   an   argument   and   provide   support   for   the argument   by exploring   relevant   references from different sources.
-   to do their   presentation   in an ef代 写CHNS3001 Chinese for Native Speakers 2 S2, 2024
代做程序编程语言fective   manner, especially   in   terms   of   delivery   skills   and audience engagement   skills.
In the   presentation, you are   NOT expected to   present a   complete   research   project.   You   can   just   present your work   in   progress and   let   us   know what you   have done   so   far   for   this project. The teachers expect you to   present clearly:
1)       your   primary   data
2)       your secondary data that you   have   collected from   CAJ   (China   Academic Journal)   Full-   text   Database and/or other   sources
3)       the   major aim or   research focus   of   your   project
4)       the   possible arguments you   have developed and the   key   distinctions   between these   arguments and those in the   previous   research
5)       the details   in support   of your   arguments.
Please the   registration and scheduling for oral   presentation   will   be   opened   in   each tutorial group   in Weeks 4 and 5. The   students who   choose   to   do   their   presentations   in   Weeks   6   and   7 will get a   bonus   point of 0.5   (for   Week   6)   and   0.25   (for   Week   7)   respectively.   Please contact your tutor for   details.
Research   project   report
The   report   needs to   be completed   in Week   13 with   2,000   English words or   about   3,000   Chinese characters. Sample   reports are available   at the   end   of the   Course   Reader.
Subheadings can   be added for each section.   Possible   sections   can   include
1)         introduction
2)         analysis
3)         discussion
4)         conclusion
5)         bibliography
The   reference style. should   be APA   7th. A complete guideline   for   APA   7th      is   available   on   the   Canvas site   in the   module for Week   1.
Possible   primary data
Each   research   project   needs to   be   2000   English words or about 3,000   Chinese   characters. You can choose   media articles from the following   list   or   literary   work   from   the   Reading   List   on Canvas to work on for the   project.   It   is   also   possible   to   choose   any   other   piece   of   work            beyond these   lists, subject to the teacher’s approval. You   are   encouraged to   find   your   own      interest and develop the   research   by   reading and thinking   around your   own   interest.
